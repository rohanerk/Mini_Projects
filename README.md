# 1. Phone Number and Email Extractor

# üìûüìß Phone Number and Email Address Extractor

This is a Python script that extracts phone numbers and email addresses from a block of text using regular expressions (regex). It is useful for scanning documents, webpages, or files to automatically collect contact details.

## Features

- Extracts phone numbers with or without country codes (e.g., +1 415-863-9900, 800-420-7240)
- Extracts email addresses (e.g., info@example.com)
- Supports common formats with dashes, spaces, parentheses, or dots
- Outputs results in a clean, labeled format

## Example Input

No Starch Press, Inc.  
Phone: 800-420-7240 or +1 415-863-9900  
Fax: +1 415-863-9950  

Emails:  
info@nostarch.com  
sales@nostarch.com

## Example Output

Phone: 800-420-7240  
Phone: +1-415-863-9900  
Phone: +1-415-863-9950  
Email: info@nostarch.com  
Email: sales@nostarch.com

## How It Works

- Uses Python‚Äôs `re` module to define patterns for phone numbers and email addresses
- Uses `.findall()` to locate all matches
- Formats and prints the results with labels


# 2. üîê Strong Password Validator

This Python script checks whether a given password is strong based on commonly accepted criteria. It uses regular expressions to validate the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and enforces a minimum length.

---

## ‚úÖ Password Strength Criteria

A strong password must:

- Be at least **8 characters long**
- Contain **at least one lowercase letter**
- Contain **at least one uppercase letter**
- Contain **at least one digit**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script defines a function called `strongpassword()` that:

1. Prompts the user to enter a password
2. Uses the `re` (regular expressions) module to search for:
   - Lowercase letters `[a-z]`
   - Uppercase letters `[A-Z]`
   - Digits `\d`
3. Prints a specific error message if any condition fails
4. Confirms the password is strong if all rules pass

# 3. üìù Random Quiz Generator

This Python script generates multiple randomized quiz files along with their answer keys. Each quiz tests knowledge of U.S. state capitals, with the order of the questions and answer options randomized to ensure each quiz is unique.

## üìå Features

- Generates multiple quiz versions (default: 35)
- Creates separate answer keys for grading
- Randomizes:
  - The order of the states
  - The placement of the correct answer among the options
- Saves files neatly in a specified output directory

## üìÇ File Output

Each run will generate:
- `capitalsquiz1.txt`, `capitalsquiz2.txt`, ..., `capitalsquiz35.txt` ‚Äî quiz files
- `capitalsquiz_answer1.txt`, ..., `capitalsquiz_answer35.txt` ‚Äî answer keys

# 4. Renaming Dates
`renameDates.py` is a Python script that searches through filenames in the current working directory and renames files with dates in the American format (`MM-DD-YYYY`) to the European format (`DD-MM-YYYY`).

### Example

**Before:**
invoice_04-25-2024.txt
report_12-31-2023.pdf

ruby
Copy
Edit

**After running `renameDates.py`:**
invoice_25-04-2024.txt
report_31-12-2023.pdf

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

## Features

- Scans all filenames in the current working directory.
- Detects dates in MM-DD-YYYY format using regex.
- Renames files by swapping MM and DD to convert to DD-MM-YYYY format.
- Skips files that do not match the American date pattern.
- Supports dry-run mode (optional customization).

---

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `renameDates.py` and the target files.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python renameDates.py
Regex Pattern Used
The script uses the following regular expression to match American-style dates in filenames:

python
Copy
Edit
r"""^(.*?)           # all text before the date
    ((0|1)?\d)-      # month
    ((0|1|2|3)?\d)-  # day
    ((19|20)\d\d)    # year
    (.*?)$           # all text after the date
"""
