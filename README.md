# Phone Number and Email Extractor

# ðŸ“žðŸ“§ Phone Number and Email Address Extractor

This is a Python script that extracts phone numbers and email addresses from a block of text using regular expressions (regex). It is useful for scanning documents, webpages, or files to automatically collect contact details.

## Features

- Extracts phone numbers with or without country codes (e.g., +1 415-863-9900, 800-420-7240)
- Extracts email addresses (e.g., info@example.com)
- Supports common formats with dashes, spaces, parentheses, or dots
- Outputs results in a clean, labeled format

## Example Input

No Starch Press, Inc.  
Phone: 800-420-7240 or +1 415-863-9900  
Fax: +1 415-863-9950  

Emails:  
info@nostarch.com  
sales@nostarch.com

## Example Output

Phone: 800-420-7240  
Phone: +1-415-863-9900  
Phone: +1-415-863-9950  
Email: info@nostarch.com  
Email: sales@nostarch.com

## How It Works

- Uses Pythonâ€™s `re` module to define patterns for phone numbers and email addresses
- Uses `.findall()` to locate all matches
- Formats and prints the results with labels
